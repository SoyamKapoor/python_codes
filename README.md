# Python Scripts Repository

Welcome to the **Python Scripts Repository**! This repository contains various Python scripts that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts and offer useful utilities. These scripts are designed to help both beginners and experienced developers with their coding journey.

## About This Repository

This repository includes a collection of Python scripts focused on different areas, including automation, data processing, utilities, and simple applications. Each script serves as a great starting point for learning Python or as a reusable utility for specific tasks.

## Repository Contents

The repository contains Python scripts that cover a wide range of topics:

- **Greeting Based on Time**: A script that greets the user based on the time of day.
- **Simple Calculator**: A script that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Other Python Scripts**: Additional scripts that focus on specific tasks like web scraping, file manipulation, or algorithm implementations (to be added in future).

## How the Code Works

Each script is standalone and can be executed independently. Below is a general breakdown of how the typical scripts work:

1. **User Input**: Most scripts take user input, either through the terminal or via an interface.
2. **Processing**: The scripts process the data using Python's built-in libraries or custom functions.
3. **Output**: The result is then displayed to the user or saved in a file, depending on the functionality of the script.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Each script might use different libraries based on its functionality. For example:
  - `datetime` (for time-related operations)
  - `math` (for mathematical calculations)
  - `requests` (for web requests)
  - And many others based on the task at hand.

## Applications

These Python scripts are useful for anyone looking to:
- Practice basic Python concepts.
- Automate simple tasks.
- Build reusable utilities for everyday use.
- Learn how to manipulate data, perform calculations, or work with external APIs.

## Future Additions

This repository will be updated regularly with new scripts. Future additions may include:
- More advanced automation scripts.
- Data processing and visualization tools.
- Algorithm implementations.
- Web scraping utilities.
- Machine learning models.

## Acknowledgments

- Thanks to the Python community and the open-source ecosystem for providing so many useful libraries and tools to help us build these projects.
